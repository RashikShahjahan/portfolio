I've started working for T-Mobile NL B.V. as a test automation engineer ~5 years ago, and eventually became a full stack .Net developer.
Focus is mainly on all the telecom domain related applications, such as customer facing applications & web apis, internal facing applications for
business and customer care executives. 

Also as sideprojects created some manual time/effort saving applications thanks to the acquired functional domain knowledge and experience.

In this project I became much more familier with DevOps and agile (SAFe) working methodology. 
This is my current project and I'm still learning new things everyday.
