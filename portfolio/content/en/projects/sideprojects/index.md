## Now üëÜüèΩ that's every developer's mindset

#### In my spare time I do sideprojects, some of them I loved doing are:

- ComicsAppWasm - It is a comic viewer app which I built while learning Blazor WebAssembly.
   - Check it out live here: [ComicsAppWasm](https://paragraut.github.io/ComicsAppWasm/)
- ComicsApi - It is quite similar to above project, the only difference is it's an webapi and written using C# & Golang.
- This portfolio/blog itself was a sideproject which is built with Hugo and Introduction theme, and there are a few more...
