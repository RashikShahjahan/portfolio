## üëÜüèΩ That's every developers mindset

### In my spare time I do sideprojects

Some of them I loved doing are:
- ComicsAppWasm - It is a comic viewer I built while learning Blazor webassembly.
Check it out here live: [ComicsAppWasm](https://paragraut.github.io/ComicsAppWasm/)
- ComicsApi - It is similar to above project only difference is it's an api.
- This portfolio itself I made as sideproject.
