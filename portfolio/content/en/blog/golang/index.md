Go, or as its easily google-able moniker, Golang, is a typed systems programming language created by Google. It was designed to be in the vein of C/C++ with Garbage Collection, simpler to read and write unlike C++, strong opinions about how code should be built and strong primitives to enable effective concurrency. It was originally designed as a thought experiment between Robert Griesemer (V8 engine, Google Distributed File System), Rob Pike (Unix Team) and Ken Thompson (B Programming Language, c predecessor).
There’s a lot of information and blogs about peoples experience with Go and I’ll link to a few of those at the end of this blog. I’ve been dabbling with Golang this last year for little side projects and a lot for the sake of learning. Coming from what most to be considered an somewhat embarrassingly long stint of doing PHP development for 4 years, it very quickly became obvious why there’s a lot of benefit to the choices made in Golang’s direction. I’ve also used Node the last 2 years for nearly all my side projects/backend work, java + objective-C for my mobile work and a bit of ruby, python and bash for scripting when it’s appropriate. For me Golang combines all the best elements of these languages, with an excellent community, build tools, it solves a bunch of problems in it’s inherent design and creates new ways to solve problems with its concurency options. I’ve been using it to build a few API’s and tools, and started toying with using some openGL bindings to make some little 2D games.
I wanted to share my thoughts on this with the larger dev community and hopefully spur on some discussions and even for a few people to dive in and try their hand at the language.

```JavaScript
  const thisIsATest = () => {
    console.log("This is funny")
